I am a 5th year Ph.D. candidate at the [mHealth lab](https://www.mhealthgroup.org/) at Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University. My research lies at the intersection of human computer interaction, behavioral science, and ubiquitous computing. I am advised by [Dr. Stephen Intille](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/intille/)
