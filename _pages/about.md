I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [mHealth lab](https://www.mhealthgroup.org/) at Northeastern University. My research lies at the intersection of human computer interaction, behavioral science, and ubiquitous computing. I am advised by [Dr. Stephen Intille](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/intille/).

During my Ph.D., I have worked on designing, buidling and evaluating smartphone applications to measure and improve health behaviors such as physical activty in both adults and teens. I also work on leveraging social connections to provide timely support to improve health behaviors. My research interests include mobile computing, machine learning, and user research. 

Previously, I graduated from [Shiv Nadar University](https://snu.edu.in/home/) with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
