We report on the feasibility testing of an in-situ sleep monitoring application that uses passive sensing to drive context-sensitive ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) to help participants recall sleep disruptions when they wake up in the morning. Participants answered over 80% of EMAs delivered during the feasibility study and could recall meaningful reasons for over 40% of noise and motion events when they answered context-sensitive questions presented in the morning EMA.
