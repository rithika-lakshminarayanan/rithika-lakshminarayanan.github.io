excerpt: 'In this work, we combine two input modalities to create a multimodal-Î¼ EMA system, allowing participants to choose between speech or touch input to self-report physical activity and posture information. This paper reports on feasibility and usability of the multimodal system based on field testing with 20 participants.'
